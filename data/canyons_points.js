It stretches from the Desecheo Island platform to the south to the Puerto Rico Trench, which contains some of the deepest points in the Atlantic Ocean, to the north. The canyon is also particularly associated with earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis, with the 1918 Puerto Rico earthquake having its epicentre here."
